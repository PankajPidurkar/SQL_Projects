ADIDAS Sales Analysis using SQL ‚ú®

In this project, I performed an analysis of ADIDAS sales data using SQL. I created a database named "pankaj" and imported a CSV file into the database. Then, I executed several SQL queries to retrieve and analyze the data. Here are some of the key insights from the analysis:

üåç Analyzed total sales by region:

Retrieved the total sales for each region.
üîù Identified the top selling products:

Determined the products with the highest total units sold.
üí∞ Calculated the average price per unit for each product.

üìä Calculated sales by sales methods:

Analyzed total sales for each sales method.
üíº Calculated total sales and operating profit for each retailer.

üìà Determined the highest and lowest selling prices of products.

üíº Calculated the average operating margin by region.

üíµ Calculated total sales and operating profit for each state and city.

üíº Calculated total sales and operating profit for each retailer and product.

üèÜ Identified the top performing region based on operating margin.

üìä Analyzed total sales by region, sales method, and product.

üíº Calculated total sales and operating profit for a specific retailer and product.

üìä Calculated total sales and operating profit for each sales method.

üèôÔ∏è Identified the top-performing city in terms of total sales.

üó∫Ô∏è Analyzed the distribution of sales across different regions, states, and cities.

üí≤ Calculated the average price per unit for each product within a specific region.

üîù Identified the top-selling products in terms of total sales within a specific region.

üíº Calculated total sales and operating profit for each retailer within a specific region.

üîù Determined the highest and lowest retailers based on total sales.

üó∫Ô∏è Analyzed sales distribution across different states within a region.

These analyses provide valuable information for understanding ADIDAS sales performance and can be utilized for making strategic business decisions. üí™üíºüí°
